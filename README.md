# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Elections tend to have a lot of information to digest, so Voting Match simplifies the information, curates it to the user, and helps voters to find representatives who actually best represent their views.

* **Competitive Analysis** -  To understand our competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and to find an edge over our competitors. Our findings pointed that our competitors don't have any information on candidates and lack user personalization.
 
* **Heuristic Evaluation** - To find competitor weaknesses as a focus point to improve our website. Our findings showed that we need to improve on error prevention, user control, and freedom, which will create a better user experiece for our site. 

* **Personas and Scenarios** - To have an idea of our potential demographics for our website. We found that Voting Match needs to be curated in a way that first time voters and non-tech savvy people can use it.
 
* **Sketches** -  Started creating sketches to have an idea of the user experience flow, and realized that a streamlined experience will be best for Voting Match.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* **Wireframes**: For this phase, we focused primarily on designing interactive wireframes that allowed users to navigate through the Voting Match interface. This is enhanced by a dynamic feature that enables users to click on buttons that go to the next page.We learned that our interface flow is fluid, and easily can be navigated through clear labeled buttons. 

* **Walkthroughs**: After finalizing our interactive wireframes, we sent them to peers for evaluation, and guided users to run through different scenarios to understand how our site works, so that we could make decisions about ways we could improve the user experience.The user who gave us feedback didnâ€™t have a wireframe with workable buttons at the time, but could still figure out how to navigate through the website.

* **Future Plan**:In user testing, we plan to add a color scheme, font choices, logo design and illustrative graphics based on user feedback. We believe that our initial design is sufficient, but needs minor changes to have a better user experience.
