# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Elections tend to have a lot of information to digest, so Voting Match simplifies the information and curates it to the user. Helps voters to find representatives who actually best represent their views.

* **Competitive Analysis** -  To understand our competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and to find an edge over our competitors. Our findings pointed that our competitors don't have any information on candidates and no user personalization.
* **Heuristic Evaluation** - To find the competitor weakness as a focus point to improve our website. Our findings showed that we have to improve on error prevention, user control and freedom that would make a better experiece for the website. 
* **Personas and Scenarios** - To have an idea of our potential demographics for our website. We found out that Voting Match needs to be curated in a way that first time voters and non-tech savy people can use it.
* **Sketches** -  Started in creating sketches of UI to have an idea of the flow of the user experience of the website. We realized a streamline expereince would be good for Voting Match.
