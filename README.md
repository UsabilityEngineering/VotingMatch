# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Elections tend to have a lot of information to digest, so Voting Match simplifies the information, curates it to the user, and helps voters to find representatives who actually best represent their views.

* **Competitive Analysis** -  To understand our competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and to find an edge over our competitors. Our findings pointed that our competitors don't have any information on candidates and lack user personalization.
 
* **Heuristic Evaluation** - To find competitor weaknesses as a focus point to improve our website. Our findings showed that we need to improve on error prevention, user control, and freedom, which will create a better user experiece for our site. 

* **Personas and Scenarios** - To have an idea of our potential demographics for our website. We found that Voting Match needs to be curated in a way that first time voters and non-tech savvy people can use it.
 
* **Sketches** -  Started creating sketches to have an idea of the user experience flow, and realized that a streamlined experience will be best for Voting Match.
