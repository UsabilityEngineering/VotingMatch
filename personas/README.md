# Scenarios

## Sophia: 
Sophia is a first time voter meaning that she hasn’t established a preferred political stance on the political spectrum. She would like to know if her political stances align with the left or the right. This will help her vote on candidates that have political stances like her in the future.

## Sophia: 
There is a general election happening in November. Sophia would like to know the candidates in the upcoming election. Would like to know the best candidate that is related to her political position.

## David: 
David would like to know the candidates who are running in the general election of 2020. He’s looking for someone like him that has been in Chico for a long time and has the same political stance as him. He prefers a Republican candidate over a Democratic candidate.   

## Caitlin: 
Caitlin just got her ballot for the general election, and cannot decide which presidential candidate to vote for. When trying to search for details about national candidates, all she can find are vague Facebook pages with empty sentiments. Caitlin needs more information, but she doesn’t know where to go.
