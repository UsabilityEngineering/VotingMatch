To find details about nominated representatives (and state propositions) in a straightforward and simplified way

# Scenarios

## Sophia: 
Sophia is a first time voter meaning that she hasn’t established a preferred political stance on the political spectrum. She would like to know if her political stances align with the left or the right. This will help her vote on candidates that have political stances like her in the future.

## Sophia: 
There is a midterm election happening in November. Sophia would like to know the elected candidates in the upcoming midterm that includes local, state, and federal candidates. Would like to know the best candidate that is related to her political position.

## David: 
The city of Chico is having a local election. David would like to know the candidates who are running in that election. He’s looking for someone like him that has been in Chico for a long time and has the same political stance as him. He prefers a Republican candidate over a Democratic candidate.  

## Liz: 
Election day is coming up in Chico, and Liz wants to be more involved this year as she’s newly retired and has more time on her hands. Heading into election season, Liz wants to find political organizations to volunteer with so that she can help to make a difference in the Chico community, but scouring the internet overwhelms her and she doesn’t know how to use social media sites like Instagram or Twitter. 

## Caitlin: 
Caitlin just got her ballot for the midterm election, and cannot decide which local and state candidates to vote for, as the physical guidebook does not make it clear what exactly each candidate supports. When trying to search for details about local Chico candidates, all she can find are vague Facebook pages with empty sentiments about being “family-oriented” or “community-focused”. Caitlin needs more information, but she doesn’t know where to go.
