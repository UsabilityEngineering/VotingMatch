# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Created a working prototype of Voting Match and tested it with real-life users, with the goals of identifying usability issues, ensuring user satisfication, and improving product effectiveness based on user feedback.

## Methods

**User Test:**  We had five participants use the prototype we created, and give us feedback. Our protocol was outlined in a Usability Test Plan Outline. The primary objectives of our user testing were to assess whether users could:

1. Create an account (or log in) successfully
2. Understand how to find and complete the 30-question Voting Match survey
3. Find and interact with the information present on the "2024 Ballot" page
    
We also observed how well users could navigate through the site without getting lost, and observed whether users could "favorite" and "un-favorite" candidates based on their personal preferences. Additionally, we documented how users comprehended information presented to them on the site. Our study did not involve comparing Voting Match to competitors. Voting Match has evolved into a very different service than the competitors we focused on during early development, so we felt this method would not provide any significance to the improvement of our product.

Since there was only one version of the prototype, we used a within-subject design for all participants, with fixed tasks. We utilized the think-aloud method to understand different user perspectives. Before beginning the tasks, we gave our users a friendly introduction and asked background questions. The tasks were:

1. Complete the steps to create an account.
2. Complete the Voting Match survey.
3. "Favorite" candidates and view them in the Profile "Favorites" tab.
4. View information on candidates by viewing the ballot.

After our users completed the tasks, we conducted a debrief and asked for their final feedback and overall impression of Voting Match.

## Findings

* **User 1** was able to navigate the site easily and did not run into issues with locating any information; suggested "clarifying wording for ballot candidates", though. Appreciated simple flow of information, felt it was not too much to comprehend.

* **User 2** mentioned that when voting in the past, it has been "hard to find stances on candidates". Was able to successfully find information on candidates after taking Voting Match Survey. Suggested incorpration of local and state election information.

* **User 3** finds voting relatively self-explanatory, but like User 2, noted that there is "a lot to read and research", especially as a first-time voter. Additionally, was easily able to use the "favorite" feature, but had a difficult time finding the Voting Match survey. Suggested to make survey easier to find, and to clarify different dropdown menus as they all have similar names. Felt that categories on homepage "Explore" section could be renamed, as they all appear too similar and were confusing to user.

* **User 4** suggested that hyperlinks could be added to candidate bio pages. Felt that log-in/sign-up flow was "super smooth", but unsure if users would know to sign up based on 'Log In' navigation field (or vice versa). Found Voting Match survey very easily, had "no troubles", appreciated simplicity of questions and answers. Additionally, this user suggested clarification on how a candidate's full profile might be accessed. Also felt that the site "flowed well", appreciated ease of returning to homepage.

* **User 5** Found it difficult to find Match survey and complete task, incorrectly assumed it was the initial sign-up survey. Confused as to where quiz was and questioned how it differed from sign-up survey. Suggested to provide full 30-question quiz upon signing up (instead of short survey). However, this user found the ballot information easily, stated that it was "pretty clear to scroll down and find the info". Suggested sticking with one survey rather than two, so as not to confuse users. Additionally suggested "more local stuff", like User 2 (referring to local and state election information).

## Conclusions

Based on user feedback, it is clear that we should make it easier to find the Voting Match survey by either changing the name of its navigation button on the homepage, or adding it to the homepage altogether. This way, users do not need to go looking for the survey; it *is* the main feature of our service, after all! Additionally, we should consider adding local and state candidates to the final version of the product, as giving users these options could drastically improve the service, and open it up to new audiences. On candidate pages, we learned that hyperlinks to candidates' official websites would be useful, and could potentially provide more credibility. To clarify the log-in/sign-up distinction, we can also change its navigation link name to "Log In / Sign Up" or find a way to incorporate both actions so that users do not feel confused or stuck clicking on a certain link. We will also focus on successfully communicating how users can view a candidate's full profile from seeing their name the ballot information page. Perhaps sticking to one survey instead of two would also be beneficial (the official 30-question survey versus the initial 10-question sign-up survey), as we do not want to confuse users or overcomplicate their experiences. Overall, our site design and layout was positively received.

## Caveats

Adobe XD has certain limitations that prevent certain functions from working correctly on the prototype. For example, rearranging political issues on a page was static instead of being dynamically placed. Not enough participants to gain a better consensus on the prototype.
