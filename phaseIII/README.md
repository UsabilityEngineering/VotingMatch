# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Created a prototype for user testing that will identify usability issues, ensure user satisfication, and improve product effectiveness based on UX expert feedback.

## Methods

**User Test**-  We had five participants who were UX experts use the prototype we created and designed to give us feedback. Our approach was outlined in a Usability Test Plan Outline. The objectives were to assess whether users could create an account or log in successfully, understand how to find and complete the Voting Match survey, observe how well users could navigate through the site without getting lost or confused, and determine whether users could add or remove their candidates based on their preferences. We also documented how users comprehended information presented to them on the site. Our study design did not compare our app to other competitors because it was quite different at this point. There was only one version of the prototype, and we used a within-subject design for all participants, with fixed tasks. We utilized the think-aloud method to understand different user perspectives. Before beginning the tasks, we gave the UX experts an introduction and asked background questions. The tasks were:

1. Complete the steps to create an account.
2. Complete the Voting Match survey.
3. "Favorite" candidates and view them in the Profile "Favorites" tab.
4. View information on candidates by viewing the ballot.

After the UX experts completed the tasks, we conducted a debrief and asked for their final feedback and overall impression of Voting Match. there was debrief amd conclusion to recieve final feedback and overall impression of Voting Match.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
