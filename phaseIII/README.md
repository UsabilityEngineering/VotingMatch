# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Created a prototype for user testing that will identify usability issues, ensure user satisfication, and improve product effectiveness based on UX expert feedback.

## Methods

**User Test**-  We had five participants use the prototype we created, and give us feedback. Our protocol was outlined in a Usability Test Plan Outline. The primary objectives of our user testing were to assess whether users could:

1. Create an account (or log in) successfully
2. Understand how to find and complete the 30-question Voting Match survey
3. Find and interact with the information present on the "2024 Ballot" page
    
We also observed how well users could navigate through the site without getting lost, and observed whether users could "favorite" and "un-favorite" candidates based on their personal preferences. Additionally, we documented how users comprehended information presented to them on the site. Our study did not involve comparing Voting Match to competitors. Voting Match has evolved into a very different service than the competitors we focused on during early development, so we felt this method would not provide any significance to the improvement of our product.

Since there was only one version of the prototype, we used a within-subject design for all participants, with fixed tasks. We utilized the think-aloud method to understand different user perspectives. Before beginning the tasks, we gave our users a friendly introduction and asked background questions. The tasks were:

    1. Complete the steps to create an account.
    2. Complete the Voting Match survey.
    3. "Favorite" candidates and view them in the Profile "Favorites" tab.
    4. View information on candidates by viewing the ballot.

After our users completed the tasks, we conducted a debrief and asked for their final feedback and overall impression of Voting Match.

## Findings

* UX Experet had no trouble creating their account
* UX Experet  was able to successfully find information on candidates after taking Voting Match Survey
* UX Experet was able to add candidates to favorites
* UX Experet was able to find the 2024 ballot and view candidate information
* UX Experet pointed out that it was hard to find Voting Match Survey
* UX Experet pointed out that there should be local and state candidates

## Conclusions

Based on user feedback, it is clear that we should make it easier to find the Voting Match survey by either changing the name of its navigation button on the homepage, or adding it to the homepage altogether. This way, users do not need to go looking for the survey; it *is* the main feature of our service, after all! Additionally, we should consider adding local and state candidates to the final version of the product, as giving users these options could drastically improve the service, and open it up to new audiences. On candidate pages, we learned that hyperlinks to candidates' official websites would be useful, and would potentially provide more credibility. We will also focus on  successfully communicating how users can view a candidate's full profile from seeing their name the ballot information page. Perhaps sticking to one survey instead of two would also be beneficial (the official 30-question survey versus the initial 10-question sign-up survey), as we do not want to confuse users or overcomplicate their experiences. Overall, our site design and layout was positively received.

## Caveats

Adobe XD has certain limitations that prevent certain functions from working correctly on the prototype. For example, rearranging political issues on a page was static instead of being dynamically placed.
