# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

To plan and visualize the layout and structure of website, and help designers and stakeholders understand how users will interact with the website and identify potential usability issues.

## Methods

**Walkthrough** - The UX team gave a wireframe which was done in Adobe XD to a user. For each action, the user would describe the action or explain what they do not want to do at the point. In addition, describe if they did the right thing to make progress toward the goal. The user would send all that information back to the UX team.

## Findings

**Walkthrough**
* User had no trouble of creating their account on website
* User can find information on candidates after taking quiz
* User can add candidates to favorite list
* User can easily update user profile and political preference
* User cannot prioritize issues and delete candidates from favorite list


## Conclusions

The need for buttons to prioritize issues and remove candidates was highlighted by user feedback. Another design recommendation will be not having user always have to login to use the website meaning that the first page will be the homepage instead of the login page. Finally, future work should prioritize incorporating visual design elements, such as color schemes and graphics.

## Caveats

One limitation of our study is the small sample size resulting from only having one user feedback. Additionally, during the walkthrough, the buttons in the wireframe were not interactive, which is an important consideration in evaluating the feedback. The UX team did not receive feedback from a user who interacted with the wireframes with functional buttons, which is something we should aim to address in future studies.
