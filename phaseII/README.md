# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

To plan and visualize the layout of the website, and help designers and stakeholders understand how users will interact with the website and identify potential usability issues.

## Methods

**Walkthrough** - The UX team sent the Adobe XD wireframes and Voting Match personas to users on the cross-team communication Slack page, and asked users to document their journey through the wireframes from the perspective of one of the personas. The team then recieved a detailed response from one user, who tested the wireframes using our "David" persona. With a bulleted list, this user documented in detail each action they took (that David might have taken), and explained their thought process behind each one. In addition, the user described where they succeeded or failed in making progress toward their goal. After completing the walkthrough, the user sent their full report back to the UX team.

## Findings

**Walkthrough**
* User had no trouble creating their account
* User was able to successfully find information on candidates after taking quiz
* User was able to add candidates to Favorites list
* User easily understood how to update user profile information and political preferences
* User pointed out that there were no opportunities to prioritize issues or remove candidates from Favorites list


## Conclusions

As highlighted by our user feedback, we discovered the need for buttons to prioritize issues and remove candidates users are uninterested in. Buttons such as these will allow users more freedom for customization. Another design recommendation we recieved is to allow users access to the main site upfront, instead of forcing users to log in or create an account before viewing the whole site (so, instead of opening with a login/sign-up flow, we might add a login/sign-up button in the navigation menu). Finally, future work will prioritize incorporating visual design elements, such as typography, color, and graphics.

## Caveats

One limitation of our study is the small sample size resulting from only having one instance of user feedback. Additionally, during the walkthrough, the buttons in the wireframe were not yet interactive, which was an important consideration in evaluating our feedback. The UX team did not receive feedback from a user who interacted with a wireframe with functional buttons, which is something we should aim to address in future studies.
