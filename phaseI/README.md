# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

During the election season, there can be a lot of information to digest for voters. Voting Match makes it easy for voters to digest that information, and shows candidates that are relevant to the voter's political stance.

## Methods

* **Competitive Analysis** – This refers to the process of assessing and comparing one's own product with those provided by competitors. This process is generally used to spot potential weaknesses in one's own product or service, as well as to find opportunities to set it apart from competing products. We used a grid that included sections such as: strengths, weaknesses, quality level, price/cost, and platform. We were able to find our competitors via Google.

* **Heuristic Evaluation** - The purpose of this process is to find possible problems with a product's usability. It entails assessing a competitor product against a list of accepted heuristics (or usability guidelines), in order to spot any problems that might detract from the user experience. The competitor we used was an app called InfoVote.

* **Personas and Scenarios** - Personas are conceptual characters that substitute for multiple user types of a product. The goal is to understand and empathize with various user groups so the product can specifically address their needs and objectives. Scenarios are narratives that show how a consumer might utilize a product in a certain situation or context, and their purpose is to understand how a product can be used in the real world.

* **Sketches** – Sketches are low-fidelity drawings of design concepts, that let UX designers explore and refine ideas without expending a lot of time or money. Sketches have been an important step in our process, as they have helped us to find the best streamline approach for bringing Voting Match to life.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

* **Competitive Analysis** – When researching similar products and services, we found that the majority of our competitors are free to use, web-based services that have user-friendly experiences. However, most of the ones we found seemed to lack the candidate-specific information we were looking for in our competition. Of the competitors we evaluated, we concluded that InfoVote, Vote411, and BallotReady were our strongest competition due to their content, quality UX design, and and ease of site navigation. We also noticed that Easy Voter Guide was the only one to include detailed information on their site about state propositions and voting guidelines.

* **Heuristic Evaluation** - To conduct our Hueristic Evaluation, we focused on a competing service called InfoVote (an educational mobile app that helps voters stay informed). During our evaluation, we noticed that the app's strongest points are Hueristics #2 (match between system and real world) and #6 (recognition rather than recall). InfoVote is designed well, uses easily understood language, has good navigation, and elements on pages are usually labeled clearly. However, the app freezes often, is tedious to use, and error recovery is poorly designed. Observing InfoVote's interface in this light helped us to recognize what we should pay attention to when designing Voting Match, and understand what we should include and avoid in our design.

* **Personas and Scenarios** - To understand the perspectives of our audience, we created the personas: Sophia, David, Caitlin, and Liz (who we later removed). These personas demonstrate the needs of our user base, and provide realistic expectations for using Voting Match. For example, one of our personas (Sophia) is a first-time voter who, as a student at Chico State, is unfamiliar with both local politics and the general election. She seeks out Voting Match to learn about candidates she might be interested in, so that she can feel more prepared and confident about her vote. Additionally, each of our scenarios represent different opportunities for how Voting Match can be used. These scenarios help us give more context to why our site is useful, and they provide a clearer visual on how we should prioritize designing the site's features.

* **Sketches** – Before we decided to officially make Voting Match a web-based service, we sketched some concepts of what might look like as a mobile app. After understanding it to be web-based, we drew out concepts for a login screen, a "create account" screen, and the steps a user might take to complete a survey after creating an account. Additionally, we sketched a concept for how a user might click on an election candidate's name, and be taken to a screen with all of the candidate's information. 

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
